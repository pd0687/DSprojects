re-submitted EDA notebook



Contents of each submission:

data wrangling notebook:

-- Delete unnecessary columns after the CSV was imported as a dataframe
-- Check data types, and coerce the target to float
-- Verify that the dates are all end-of-month
-- Check to see how many nulls there are in each of the features and the target, check how many rows are free of nulls, and
   drop rows containing any nulls
-- Engineer new feature
-- Check if NaN in the new feature, and coerce NaN's to zero
-- Check if infinity entries in the new feature, and coerce to 9999
-- Rearrange/swap the last two columns so that the target is rightmost
-- Delete the feature that was used for engineering the new feature
-- Create function that groups by date and discretizes the (continuous) features into 5 quantiles
-- Create function that discretizes the target -- 1 if the next month's return lies above the median, 0 otherwise

EDA notebook:

-- Group the observations by date and compute the mean for all continuous features, then plot the grouped mean for each feature
-- Correlation matrix and heatmap for the continuous features for the ungrouped and the grouped (as above) dataframe
-- Simple linear regression where the continuous target is regressed on each of the continuous features
-- Histograms, skewness, and kurtosis for each of the continuous features and for the continuous target
-- Confidence intervals for each of the continuous features and for the continuous target
-- Subset the discrete target into "underperform" and "outperform," compute each observation's features' quantile average,
   then perform the difference of means test to see if outperforming stocks have features that belong to quantiles that are
   higher than those for underperforming stocks
